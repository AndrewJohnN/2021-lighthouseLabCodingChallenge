    "In Python, variables are structures that store values within them. A variable can be in the form of a string, an integer, or even a list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_a = 'This is a string.'\n",

    "var_c = ['This','is','a','list','on', 'the',21,'day data challenge.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: In the example above, var_c is a list. A list are a type of data structure that can be sequenced. Lists can contain many items that can be indexed by integers, and each item are seperated by the ','.\n",

    "Strings are how text is represented in a computer program, and are considered a unique type of data. You can think of them as a sequence of characters.\n",
